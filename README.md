# Local Projections in MATLAB

This repository provides simple MATLAB implementations of **Local Projections (LP)** and **Local Projections with Instrumental Variables (LP-IV)**.  

## Files

- **`LP.m`** – estimates impulse responses using standard local projections.  
- **`LP_IV.m`** – extends the method to an instrumental variable (IV) framework.  
- **`lpiv.xlsx`** – dataset used as an application for both LP and LP-IV.  

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `.m` files.  
2. Download `lpiv.xlsx` and place it in the same folder as the MATLAB files.  
3. Run either:  
   - `LP.m` for standard local projections.  
   - `LP_IV.m` for IV-based local projections.
